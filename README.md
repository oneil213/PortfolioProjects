# Adeola Oni - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, Iâ€™m Adeola! With an analytical background, an Engineering degree and having recently concluded a Data Analytics programme with LSE (London School of Economics and Political Science), I have refined my skills in extracting actionable insights from intricate datasets. My professional journey spans across diverse industries, ranging from power to healthcare, where I have collaborated with cross-functional teams to tackle business challenges through data-driven decision-making. Proficient in programming languages including Python, R, SQL, and JavaScript, I excel in manipulating large datasets and constructing predictive models.

Committed to continuous learning, I keep abreast of the latest trends and technologies in data analytics to deliver innovative solutions. With a keen eye for detail and a penchant for problem-solving, I thrive in environments that prioritize data-driven strategies, contributing significantly to organizational success.

In my leisure time, I delight in exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, constantly seeking opportunities to broaden my knowledge and skills. Whether working collaboratively or independently, I am fueled by the excitement of uncovering fresh insights and the gratification of employing data to resolve intricate problems.

My CV in [pdf](XXXXXXX).

This is a repository to showcase skills, share some of my work in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Performance Improvement Analysis for a Game Store

**Code:** [Performance improvement analysis-Game Store](https://github.com/oneil213/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/game_store_performance_improvement.ipynb)

**Description:** The project focuse on the use of linear regression to predict how customers accumulate loyalty points, then summarizing the process and results in a report and presentation. Also applying k-means clustering to segment customers based on spending scores, analysing customer sentiments from reviews using natural language processing, visualiese sales data trends, perform statistical analysis, and provide recommendations to the game store, summarizing my findings in reports and presentations.

**Goal:** The goal is to analyze customer engagement, loyalty programs, segmentation strategies, and text data to enhance marketing campaigns and business improvements. Additionally, to uncover trends and insights within sales data, evaluate its suitability for modeling, and explore potential relationships between North American, European, and global sales.

**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis (EDA), Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, Statistical analysis, Communication, Problem-solving, Domain knowledge,

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy. Statsmodel, Sklearn, scipy,Counter,Textblob, WordCloud , Nltk

**Results:** The insights suggest leveraging positive sentiments and customer testimonials in marketing materials, targeting tailored campaigns, addressing negative feedback through improvements showcased in marketing, and incorporating specific terms and customer quotes to resonate with the audience, while also embracing diversity of opinions and continuously iterating marketing strategies based on evolving trends and feedback.

### Analysing the Performance of an Electricity Distribution Company

**Code:** [`Analyzing the P of electricity distribution`](https://github.com/oneil213/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/electricity_distribution_performance.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of electicity disrtibution, customers, collection and billing records. The records include the energy recieved, energy distributed, energy losses, amount collected and amount billed. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing losses.

**Goal:** To examine the aggregate commerical and technical losses of companys area offices and extract meanigful insights as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, SQL Server.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib , Seaborn.

**Results:** The results emphasize the importance of investigating and mitigating outliers in AT&C Losses, focusing on improving billing efficiency, leveraging insights from the correlation matrix for data-driven decision-making, optimizing energy distribution processes, conducting seasonal performance analysis, establishing continuous monitoring and improvement systems, and promoting cross-office knowledge sharing to drive operational efficiency and performance improvements organization-wide
